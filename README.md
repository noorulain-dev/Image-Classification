Image classification into categories using CNN

-


This process is highly important in determining the validity of your model; thus, the appropriate 
methods should be used to measure the results of the classification. Depending on the method 
chosen, critical details about a model can be pointed, such as the accuracy of the overall results as 
well as the level of bias & variance to reveal problems of underfitting or overfitting. The evaluation 
methods we ended up choosing were the classification graph and confusion matrix. We concluded 
that the confusion matrix will provide a direct and easy approach to figuring out exactly how many 
predictions were correct as compared to those that turned out to be wrong.
